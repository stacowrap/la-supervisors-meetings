# la-supervisors-meetings
Structured historical meeting data from the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors


Inspired by Matt Stiles' observablehq notebook here:

> This notebook is an experiment for making historical records about the meetings of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors more accessible and ultimately using them for stories.

> In L.A. County, board meetings are documented online in four key ways:

> Statements of proceedings: Detailed minutes describing how members voted and commented in sequence on agenda motions during their weekly meetings.

> Supporting documents: Longer narrative documents describing each agenda item from the meetings. These are critical for understanding board actions.

> Board transcripts: Court reporter files that contain each word spoken during the meeting in sequence. Great for grabbing past comments or understanding the context of a historic debate â€” or documenting how often members of the public use obscenities during comment periods.

> Board motions: Formal descriptions of agenda items with carefully worded, legalistic phrasing to explain each board motion or action.

> These records [are searchable from the county's website](https://www.lacounty.gov/sop/#), a decent interface for individual queries. But that service also exposes data about all these meetings from its API endpoints.
